# FlowFieldPathfinding
My Flow Field implementation to use in Unity(Monobehaviours) and DOTS (Except ECS).

Flow Field pathfinding is used for navigation of huge number of agents. Some of the videogames using this pathfinding approach is: Age of Empires 4, Supreme Commander 2,

TODO's
1 - Pathfinding with moving destinations. (Easy)
5 - Imlementing a heightmap to support 2.5d terrain.

Far Future Plans:
1 - Rewriting the system using DOTS, specifically ECS.
